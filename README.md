### Introduction 

**OneForAll** is a donation based free food web application that offers direct delivery service for low income families in need.
In collaboration with my team,our goal from the start was to help eliminate world hunger by bringing food drives online. 


### App Concept + Design Approach 

**"49 million people** are officially food insecure: They donâ€™t always know where their next meal is coming from. 
From our farms to grocery stores to dinner tables, **30%** of the food we grow is never eaten." **-The National Geographic**


### Beyond MVP 

- Target certain geographical areas in local communities within New York City first. 
- Partner up with potential retailers, restaurants and churches to further our steps.
- Build out a **bonus rewards** feature for every donor that has the most donations within a month.
